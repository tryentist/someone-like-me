# assumptions
1. in building this information in an electronic tool on the web, i implicitly assume that people who use this resource will have access to a computer and are not banned from viewing this information. it is a big assumption, as there are many people that do not have the privilige of this access.  this must be explored and examined.
2. i assume that i am a flawed person with huge blind spots.  
  * i further assume i will Get a Lot of Things Wrong.
  * i even further assume that I will hear about it.
  * i invite this to happen.
